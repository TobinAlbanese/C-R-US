You have to git pull everytime you want an updated version of the website
    If you don't you will be stuck on the same folder while everyone else is on updated



 TO PUSH & PULL & ADD TO GIT HUB
CLONE REPO:                 git clone https://github.com/TobinAlbanese/C-R-US/tree/main
                                (or just pull from starting menu and that should be updated version)

PULL REPO:                  git pull origin main    (pulls main files from github)

CREATE BRANCH:              git checkout -b "branch name"
                                to switch between branches: git switch "branch name"

STAGING FILES FOR ADD:      git add . (for all changes you made)
                            git add (for specific files/folders"file name: index.html")

COMMITING CHANGES:          git commit -m "type reasoning here in quotes"

(you can git pull again for sync but not necessary we aren't working with 100 files)

PUSHING CHANGES:            git push origin "branch name" (for branches)
                            git push origin main (for main (entire git))





            TO BRANCH:
first pull git into vs code for updated folder

create a branch by;     git checkout -b (branch name)

make changes to your own version of the folder (aka branch)

before finishing; git pull origin main 
            (we pull it again but this time by the main branch we will be working on separate branches
            and this allows us to pull in updated folder to our separate branch
            if git has no conflicts it should be good to go)



If you happen to get PORT error or EADDRINUSE
Run this code:          lsof -i:5000
                        (after running lsof a code segment should appear under 
                        PID there should be 4 digits)
                        kill -9 (that PID 4 digit number)
    you have to go into server.js and change the port
        just change it from 5000 to maybe 5001 but this error shouldn't occur after I fixed it.
